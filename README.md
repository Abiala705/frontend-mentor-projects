## My process

I built this qr code component using Semantic HTML5 markup and CSS custom properties.

### What I learned

I learned how to use the box model in styling elements which are defined by classes. I had to style each elements with various attributes which include margin, padding and others. At a point, I was using my phone calculator to guess right the height and width as well as the other properties of the CSS box model.
Taking on this project made me to understand how various attributes works. For example, I had difficulties centering a div which I spent close to an hour. But I will get better with time.
I also downloaded the 'Outfit' font on google foots and I had to check various resources online to use the font. Then I stumbled on @font face property.

### Continued development

In my next project, I will be learning how 'box-shadow' attribute works, it adds aesthetic to the container. Looking forward to build and develop more project.

### Useful resources

- [Web Fonts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Web_fonts) - This helped me in solving the font family issue. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
